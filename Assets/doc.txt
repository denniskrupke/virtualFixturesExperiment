### Project description ###

This Unity project is developed for my HCI Bachelor thesis. It contains a virtual Labratory environment with an interactive robotic arm.
Three courses with increased complexity are setup up for time and path tracking with multiple test subjects. The gathered data is
analyzed and tested against the hypothesis that a user relies more on virtual fixtures given a rise in complexity through the test situation.

### Key Scripts and Objects ###

* UR5-Target: This GameObject is the interaction interface to move the robotic arm using the Vive Controller. 
The GripButton is used to bind the robotic arm to the Vive Controller. Using the Trigger Button, the _targetObject is set as child of the UR5-Target.
As long as the Trigger Button is pressed, movement of the the _targetObject is possible.

* _targetObject: In the test scenario, it has to be moved to the _targetArea following a predefined path. Data collection starts at pickup and stops
when the _targetObject is released withoin the _targetArea

* [CameraRig]/Controller/Grip Point: Part of the ViveGrip Asset. Enables Interaction with the GameObjects using different scripts.
Grab input and Interaction input can be mapped to different buttons on the Controller through public variables in the editor.

* Vive Grip_Grabbable [req: RigidBody]: Makes GameObjects movable/grabbable with the Vive Controller
* Vive Grip_Interactable: Enables actions triggered by the Interaction input specified in the Grip Point editor.
* Vive Grip_EventBridge: Easy event triggering on predefined Vive Grip Events. Used to atach/detach children to enable movement.

* VF_Force: Deals with the haptic and visual feedback based on surface to surface distance from targetobject to virtual fixture. Uses Lerp to change values dynamically.

### Todo ####

* Virtual Fixtures: Dummy Virtual Fixtures have to be setup with repelling force functions in one direction. EDIT VF_Force.cs Script
